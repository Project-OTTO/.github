## Project Overview

**Project-OTTO** is designed to automate code generation using AI technologies. The CLI tool integrates with various AI models to assist developers in writing code, generating boilerplate, and automating repetitive tasks. By leveraging AI, **Project-OTTO** aims to enhance productivity and reduce the manual effort involved in coding.

## Features

### AI-Powered Code Generation

- **Code Boilerplate Generation:** Automatically generate boilerplate code for various programming languages and frameworks.
- **Smart Code Suggestions:** Receive context-aware code suggestions based on the current project and codebase.
- **Snippet Generation:** Create reusable code snippets and templates for common tasks and patterns.

### Integration and Automation

- **Seamless Integration:** Integrate with popular IDEs and development tools for a smooth workflow.
- **Automated Testing:** Generate and run automated tests based on the code being developed.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Automate the CI/CD pipeline to streamline code deployment.

### Customization and Personalization

- **Configurable Settings:** Customize the tool’s settings to match your development environment and preferences.
- **Personalized Code Templates:** Create and manage personalized code templates for specific project needs.

### Enhanced Developer Experience

- **Interactive CLI:** Use an interactive CLI with features like autocompletion and help commands.
- **Version Control Integration:** Automatically generate and manage version control commits and branches.

## Architecture

**Project-OTTO** utilizes a modern architecture to deliver efficient code generation and automation:

- **AI Models:** Employ advanced AI models for code generation and suggestions.
- **Serverless Functions:** Use serverless technologies (e.g., Azure Functions) for scalability and efficient processing.
- **CLI Tool:** A command-line interface developed in Python using Click for interacting with AI models and automation features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org) (version 3.7 or higher)
- [Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com) for deploying serverless functions (optional).
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for containerization and deployment.
